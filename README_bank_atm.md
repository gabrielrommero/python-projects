# Bank Account Manager

This project simulates basic bank account operations using a BankAccount class.

- BankAccount.py defines the class with methods for deposit, withdrawal, and overdraft check.
- The main script allows PIN login and lets the user perform operations like withdraw, deposit, check balance, and overdraft status.


## How to run
Make sure both BankAccount.py and the main script are in the same folder, then:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gabrielrommero/python-projects.git
cd python-projects
python ATM.py
python BankAccount.py
